# Decentralized Peer Review – Fund 13 Open-Access Repository

Welcome! This public repo hosts **all non-confidential outputs** from our Project Catalyst Fund 13 research into a decentralized, Cardano-based peer-review and publishing model.  
Everything here is released under **CC 0 1.0 Universal** (public-domain dedication) so anyone can read, reuse, or build on the work.

## 📄 What’s Inside
1. **Research reports** – Three milestone manuscripts detailing:  
   * key pain points in traditional peer review  
   * a survey of existing decentralized publishing platforms  
   * first-hand insights from academic interviews  
2. **Functional specification** – requirements and architecture for an MVP peer-review dApp on Cardano.  
3. **Roadmap** – a phased 12-month plan (design → build → pilot) for the MVP.  
4. **Video summaries** – short explainer videos for each milestone and the final exit report.

All PDFs live in **`/docs/`** for easy download. Large videos are hosted on Google Drive and linked here.
