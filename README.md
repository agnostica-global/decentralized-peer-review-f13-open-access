## 📄 What’s Inside
1. **Research reports** – Three milestone manuscripts detailing:  
   * key pain points in traditional peer review  
   * a survey of existing decentralized publishing platforms  
   * first-hand insights from academic interviews  
2. **Functional specification** – requirements and architecture for an MVP peer-review dApp on Cardano.  
3. **Roadmap** – a phased 12-month plan (design → build → pilot) for the MVP.  
4. **Video summaries** – short explainer videos for each milestone and the final exit report.

All PDFs live in **`/docs/`** for easy download. Large videos are hosted on YouTube and linked here.
